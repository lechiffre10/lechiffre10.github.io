      <p> Can you tell me about positioning types in CSS and the differences?<br>There's a number of ways to position your elements on a website using CSS. The different methods are static,fixed,relative and absolute positioning.Before diving into each method and how they differentiate, it's important to consider each content of your element as residing in a box.Visually, this will help understand how positioning works in CSS (and ultimately how it's displayed on the page). Now that we know that each element consists of its own "box", we also have to consider how an element can be the child of a parent element in HTML (example: p tag is the child element of body tag in HTML).Now that we've established that, let's discuss the differences. The first,static, is the default positioning type in CSS. It's also called natural flow, as elements are on top of another ( think of a box on top of a box) and this is their position by default. Every block-element in static positioning will appear on a new line.<br>The second type is relative positioning. Relative positioning is simply the positioning relative to it's normal flow( static). What this means is that you can offset the position of an element ( using properties such as top,left,right or bottom) to move the element relative to its normal positioning (normal flow). Changing the positioning of an element from normal flow to relative doesn't affect the positioning of elements surrounding it and they remain static.<br>Absolute positioning changes the position of the element relative to the containing element( or parent element as explained earlier with paragraph tag and body tag). What this means is simply you're changing the position of the element in relation to it's parent element as opposed to the normal flow of the element.<br>This bring us to the fixed positioning. Fixed positioning is a type of Absolute positioning, the property of the element is set to fixed and is positionined in relation to the browser window as opposed to the containing element.Setting an element to fixed positioning means that when the user scrolls on the website, the element is fixed to the viewpoint (example, setting the side navigation bar to fixed means that it will stick to the screen even when the user scrolls up and down). I hope this was a bit of an insightful blog post to those curious about the different positioning types in CSS. There's a lot more to it and various ways to position elements on a website ( eg:using float) but we'll leave that for another time! See you next time!
