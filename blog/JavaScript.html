      <p> Today we're going to be looking at Ruby hashes and Javascript objects.We'll be diving into differences and similiarties and as promised, no puns after the new year.In Ruby, we use a key value pair as a means of data structure and it looks like this:<br><code class="code"> athlete = {sport:"Basketball",age:31,name:"Lebron James"}</code><br> In Javascript its very similar however we start with the keyword var for variable and then we create an object with a property and value (similar to key value pair) and it looks like this:<br><code class="code"> var athlete ={sport: "Basketball",age: 31,name:"Lebron James"};</code> We notice they are very similar albeit slight syntax difference but one difference is that in Ruby a key be of any data type (strings,numbers,symbols,hashes) whereas in Javascript a property can only be a variable. In Javascript we can use dot notation or brackets to access the value of a property and they are different. If you want to access the sport value in ruby we would do:
      <code class="code"> athlete[:sport]</code> and this would return "Basketball". In Javascript, we can access the sport property value by the dot notation as such <code class="code"> athlete.sport or athlete["sport"]</code> The problem with the dot notation is visible when you create a new variable that points to the value of sport (eg: var newSport= sport) if you then attempt to return the value by doing so <code class="code"> athlete.newSport</code> it should return as undefined. The reason is because the dot notation will explicitly look for a property with the name of newSport in the object and if it isn't available it will return undefined. We can correct that by using the bracket notation as athlete[newSport] and it should return "Basketball". We also have to use bracket notation for numbers as the dot notation does not work in that case. I hope this was a brief but instructive overview of the difference between ruby Hashes and Javascript objects. Enjoy your coding!
