      <p> This week we'll be looking at recursion in programming.So what is recursion? When you have a complex
        and large problem to resolve, recursion involves breaking down that large problem into smaller instances of the same problem and then resolving the smaller problem( which then helps solve the larger problem).Akin to russian dolls, you initially start off with the large russian doll, but then inside is a smaller russian doll(and so on)
        until it's small enough that there are no more russian dolls. In programming, recursion involves a function that calls itself. The factorial function is a perfect example to illustrate recursion. We know that n! is equal to
        <code class="code">n *(n-1)! so 4! = 4*3*2*1 or 4!= 4 * 3!</code> Here, we would compute n! by
        solving for (n-1)! which represents  a smaller instance of the problem (n!) and then compute n! There's a lot more to this topic and I invite you to do a little bit of research as its not only interesting but covers a number of ways recursion applies. Have a good week!</p>
