      What are the benefits of version control?
      Before discussing the benefits of version control we should define it beforehand. Version control is a system of tracking that allows any modifications or changes to be traced back to. What this means is simply if any changes are made that could potentially negatively affect a "version" of a project we can return to any previous version before this error or mistake and work from there. The benefits are enormous as it saves time and makes work more efficient. It also avoids work overlap when working and collaborating with others on more complicated projects. Git, the version control we will be discussing in this blog post, is the version control tool used on the website GitHub. It thus allows us to see who made which changes and when and makes work a lot more efficient.

        How does git help you keep track of changes?
        There are three stanges to a change on git. The first,the working stage, is basically the first step when you are working on a file in a directory and making any modifications. This stage is untracked or isn't saved yet. The second stage when you would like to add the modifications before "committing" them or saving them is the "staged". When you are done working and want to save your progress ( just like a checkpoint in a videogame) you then "commit" the last stage of git stages. These three steps allow to ensure modifications are made properly and once saved you can see when the change was made and who made the change as well with a simple "git log" command on the command line.

        Why use GitHub to store your code?
        GitHub is a remote hub. On GitHub you can store your code and collaborate on projects with other developers. This community and "social" coding website is a great haven to store code because it allows others to look at your code before you submit to your master branch ( where all your working code is!) and adds an extra layer of protection. Not too get too much in depth with GitHub lingo, but you do this by making a "Pull request" which basically lets others know that you'd like your code to be reviewed.
