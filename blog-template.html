How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was great! I had mostly set up the wireframe before the pairing session and compared it with my pair. We applied the structure with the HTML code but it's a bit frustrating without the formatting and CSS. One thing at a time! But I find it very helpful to work with a pair because of the inexperience involved in wireframing and it's great to discuss that with someone else.
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Absolutely! I find it helps organizing the code and the content of the HTML code. The semantic elements make sense in a website and with the wireframe it helps put things in visual order and to know what code to use and where. I find it incredibly helpful.
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
To keep it simple. Seeing as these are blog posts it's important not to have too much information on the page and to keep the content interesting so a good wireframe should structure the blog page in a way that's easy for people to read and navigate without having too much stuff.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
The article semantic from HTML5 applies here in the blog posts. The use of the footer as well is helpful. Most other semantic elements were pretty much learned while doing other challenges.
