    <hr>
    <p id="about">Here's a little bit of my background story leading up to this website!<br>Born in 1987 in Abu Dhabi and moved to Montreal, Canada in 1998.Pursued studies in both English and French, and then opted for business school with
      a specialization in Finance at John Molson school of Business. I have experience in brokerage and trading as well and decided to switch to programming considering my passion for the tech and software industry. I love to travel as well! After graduating, my friends and I did a Eurotrip in 2009. My most recent backpacking trip was going solo in Japan in 2013 and it completely changed my life.As for my quirky side, I'd have to say growing up I've always had a passion for music and singing and consider myself an extraordinary shower singer!<br> If you'd like to learn a little bit more feel free to contact me!</p>
